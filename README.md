# Dataset-for-Sexism-Detection-in-Hausa-Language
This repository was created to provide the initial dataset and baseline for Sexism Detection in the Hausa Language. 
It contains three files:
The first file includes the augmented English dataset from  **the SemEval-2023 Task 10: Explainable Detection of Online Sexism** by First Hannah et al. (https://github.com/rewire-online/edos), along with the sexist and non-sexist instances derived from the research,  **Detection and Analysis of Offensive Online Content in Hausa Language** by Adam et al. (https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings_aai4g/2024/1).

The second file contains only the purely translated Hausa instances from both of the aforementioned research studies.

The third file contains the definition of sexism in the Hausa Language, extracted from a user study.

The dataset will be updated promptly from social media platforms, including X and Facebook.
