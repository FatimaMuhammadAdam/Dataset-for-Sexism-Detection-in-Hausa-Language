# Dataset-for-Sexism-Detection-in-Hausa-Language
This repository was created to provide the initial dataset and baseline for Sexism Detection in the Hausa Language. 
It contains three files:
The first file includes the augmented English dataset from the SemEval-2023 Task 10: Explainable Detection of Online Sexism, along with the sexist and non-sexist instances derived from the research, "Detection and Analysis of Offensive Online Content in Hausa Language."

The second file contains only the purely translated Hausa instances from both of the aforementioned research studies.

The third file contains the definition of sexism in the Hausa Language, extracted from a user study.

The dataset will be updated timely manner from social media platforms such as X and Facebook.
